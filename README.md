# Which-Restaurant-IOS-APP
An iOS application I developed during the summer between my junior and senior years. In this application, users answers several questions about their preferences for restaurants. Then, when they wanted to eat with their friends they can create a group and it will find the place to eat that will be acceptable to everyone.
